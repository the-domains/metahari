description: 'I recently switched a site search from using external Google CSE search to using the internal Drupal Core search. This was fairly inconsequential. I switched to Node search under Config -> Search and Metadata, swapped the CSE block out of my sidebar in Content ->Structure, made a few theme CSS changes to match and I should have been done.'
