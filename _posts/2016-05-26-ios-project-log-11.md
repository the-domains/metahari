**iOS Project Log 11**

Ah, end of semester is drawing near, and I've got a conference and an apartment relocation going on all in the last 2 weeks! eek! ok. Full speed ahead on this.

I copied the todo list from the previous log, and have crossed things out that I'm just don't have time for now.

This with an X mean I've started and/or finished an item. Today's work specifically meant struggling with Xcode and auto-layout.

### **Design**

Designers have sent me some UI assets, still waiting on level pieces for the actual maze. Working with what I have lying around.

### **Hero**

* X get hero graphics in,
* animating properly.

### **Levels**

* Parse Json mazes
* figure out how to parse image names in with the tmx file (maybe)
* X Establish tile grid sizes -- 70 x 70 or aspect 1:1
* Create new sks mazes -- working on this

### **Menus**

* X Start menu l
* X Play button goes to first game level
* X pauseSettings scene -- options don't do anything yet.
* X Credits scene -- need to add links

### **Illusions?**

* may need to revisit this idea this summer
* crop/mask
* explore scenekit for enemies.

### **Sound**

* find bandura/mandolin/string sounds/chords for up/down/left/right audio -- a friend has offered to synth some things for me.
* tweak background music.
* explore using SKaudio with UDLR sounds to help you know if you
* are near/far from goal.
* need hero movement sounds. perhaps some ambient ruins/castle sounds. Things sound stark.

it's progress, right?
